# Mathematical-Discord-Assistant
This is a discord bot written using the Discord and Wolfram Alpha API's for python.  Its intended functionality is to provide requested information from the Wolfram Alpha database such as graphs and information when provided equations.  Alternatively, it can provide various other information including dates, names, definitions, etc.  


**Bot Prefix = !**


**help**\
provides the help menu you are seeing right now.


**embedTest**\
Outputs an example of an embed block.


**clear**\
Takes one input (number of lines to clear) and removes the specified number of lines from the current channel. If no number is specified, 5 lines will be removed.


**load**\
Takes one input (the name of a new cog) and loads it.


**unload**\
Takes one input (the name of an existing cog) and unloads it.


**reload**\
Takes one input (the name of an existing cog) and unloads and loads it again.


**ping**\
Provides bot ping in ms.


**8ball**\
Takes one input (a yes or no question) and randomly selects a response like an 8 ball toy would.


**wolf**\
Takes in one input and returns requested information in an image format. This command's intended purpose is to display mathematical equations graphically, but can technically be used to provide other information such as dates, people, definitions, etc. If an error is encountered, first check your spelling. If this is not the issue, it is likely your question is simply not valid for the wolfram image format.

Note: This command displays ALL information. To only see the first couple results, try the !less command.


**less**\
Does the same as wolf, but only displays the first two results.\
